## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. Set:
 Time: O(1)  
 Space: O(1)
 
2. Get:

	Time: O(1)  
	Space: O(1)
	
3. Contains:

	Time: O(1)  
	Space: O(1)
	
4. Keys:

	Time: O(n)
	Space: O(n)
	
	
5. Hash:

	Time: O(1)
	Space: O(1)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
1. Set:  
	Arguments: key, value
	Returns: nothing
	
2. Get:  
	Arguments: key
	Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

3. Contains:  
	Arguments: key
	Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

4. Keys:  
	Returns: Collection of keys

5. Hash:  
	Arguments: key
	Returns: Index in the collection for that key
